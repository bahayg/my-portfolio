  <h2>My Projects</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>New Zealand</li>
    <p>This project is built to describe the place that I'd like to go on vacation. New Zealand was chosen to explain it in detail. HTML, CSS and Bootstrap were used to create it. Here is the <a href="https://github.com/bahayg/new-zealand"> link </a> to its GitHub page.</p>
    <li>My First Week at Epicodus</li>
    <p>My goal was to summarize the things that I have learned at Epicodus during my first week in this project. To built this website; HTML, CSS and Bootstrap were used. If you want to check it out, here is its <a href="https://github.com/bahayg/week-in-review"> link. </a></p>
    <li>My Favorite Band</li>
    <p>My friend Cynthia and I prepared this webpage to tell about Cynthia's favorite band; ODESZA. We used HTML and CSS to complete this project. You can find the GitHub page <a href="https://github.com/bahayg/favorite-band"> link </a> here. </p>
  </ol>
  <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Learning is one of the things that I value most in my life. I want to learn coding, because I believe I have strong problem-solving skills and be able to pay attention to details. I hope I will be happy and productive enough to serve humanity in my new journey!</p>
